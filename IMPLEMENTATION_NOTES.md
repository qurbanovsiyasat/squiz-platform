- **User Authentication:** Required for file uploads
- **Client-side Validation:** Immediate feedback

## ‚è≥ Backend Setup Required

### Database Schema
- `form_attachments` table needs to be created
- RLS policies need to be configured
- Indexes for performance optimization

### Supabase Storage
- `form-attachments` bucket creation
- Storage policies configuration
- Public access setup

### Edge Function

- Metadata storage integration

## üöÄ Ready for Testing

The frontend implementation is complete and ready for testing. Once the backend setup is completed according to `DATABASE_SETUP.md`, the file upload feature will be fully functional.

### Test Scenarios
1. **Image Upload:** Test with various image formats (JPG, PNG, WebP)
2. **PDF Upload:** Test PDF file uploads
3. **Mobile Camera:** Test camera capture on mobile devices
4. **Validation:** Test file type and size validation
5. **Multiple Files:** Test uploading multiple files
6. **Form Integration:** Test file attachments in form creation and viewing

### Performance Considerations

- Error handling with user-friendly messages
- Efficient file compression and validation

## üì± Mobile-First Implementation

The implementation prioritizes mobile users with:
- Camera access for direct photo capture
- Touch-optimized drag-and-drop zones
- Responsive image previews
- Mobile-friendly progress indicators
- Optimized for slow network connections

## üîí Security Implementation

- **Client-side validation** for immediate feedback
- **Server-side validation** in edge functions
- **File type restrictions** to prevent malicious uploads
- **Size limits** to prevent abuse
- **User authentication** required for all uploads
- **RLS policies** for secure data access

The file upload system is production-ready once the backend components are deployed.
