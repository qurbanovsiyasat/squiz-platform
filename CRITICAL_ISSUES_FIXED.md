# Critical Issues Fixed - Comprehensive Report

## 🚨 **Issues Identified and Resolved**

### **✅ 1. Missing Supabase RPC Functions (404 Errors)**

**Problem**: Critical RPC functions were missing, causing 404 errors:
- `delete_category` - Category deletion failed
- `assign_admin_role` - Admin role assignment failed

**Solution Applied**:
- ✅ Deployed `delete_category` function with enhanced error handling
- ✅ Deployed `assign_admin_role` function with proper return types
- ✅ Added `can_user_create_quiz` function for quiz permissions
- ✅ Applied proper permissions and security definer settings

**Result**: All admin functions now work correctly without 404 errors.

---

### **✅ 2. Frontend Code Errors (undefined isAdmin)**

**Problem**: `isAdmin` variable was causing crashes in Q&A and other sections.

**Solution Applied**:
- ✅ Fixed AdminContext error handling with proper try-catch structure
- ✅ Removed duplicate catch blocks causing syntax errors
- ✅ Added comprehensive fallback logic for admin context failures
- ✅ Enhanced error boundaries to prevent crashes

**Result**: No more "isAdmin is not defined" errors or component crashes.

---

### **✅ 3. Form Creation and Query Issues**

**Problem**: Forms were created but disappeared due to query failures:
- "Basic forms query error"
- "All forms queries failed"

**Solution Applied**:
- ✅ Fixed incorrect SQL syntax in forms query (`creator:creator_id` structure)
- ✅ Simplified query to use proper foreign key relationships
- ✅ Added proper error handling for form queries
- ✅ Enhanced fallback mechanisms for form data retrieval

**Result**: Forms now persist correctly and can be retrieved without errors.

---

### **✅ 4. Quiz Creation Permission Issues**

**Problem**: Users couldn't create quizzes due to missing permission functions.

**Solution Applied**:
- ✅ Created `can_user_create_quiz` RPC function
- ✅ Created `can_current_user_create_quiz` convenience function
- ✅ Fixed quiz permission checking logic
- ✅ Enhanced role-based access control

**Result**: Quiz creation permissions now work correctly based on user roles.

---

### **✅ 5. Admin Context Stability Issues**

**Problem**: Admin context crashes were causing application instability.

**Solution Applied**:
- ✅ Implemented robust error handling in AdminContext
- ✅ Added multiple fallback mechanisms for role detection
- ✅ Fixed syntax errors in try-catch blocks
- ✅ Enhanced super admin email handling

**Result**: Admin context is now stable and handles errors gracefully.
