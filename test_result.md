        comment: "CRITICAL: Settings page requires authentication but no backend is running. App uses Supabase authentication but cannot access settings page without valid login. Frontend code shows proper structure with HESAB, TƏRCİHLƏR, ÜMUMİ sections and all required dialogs (password, notifications, theme, language, dashboard settings) but cannot test functionality due to authentication barrier. Need backend setup or demo credentials."
