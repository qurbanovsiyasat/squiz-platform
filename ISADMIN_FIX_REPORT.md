# isAdmin Error Fix Report

## Issue
The deployed website was showing 'ReferenceError: isAdmin is not defined' on the Q&A page, indicating improper usage of the admin context.

## Root Cause
In `QAQuestionPage.tsx`, the component was attempting to manually handle the admin context with error handling, creating a direct `isAdmin` variable instead of properly using the `useAdmin()` hook.

## Fix Applied
**File:** `/src/pages/QAQuestionPage.tsx`

**Before:**
```tsx
// Safely get admin context with error handling
let adminContext
let isAdmin = false

try {
  adminContext = useAdmin()
  isAdmin = adminContext?.isAdmin || false
} catch (error) {
  console.warn('Failed to load admin context:', error)
  isAdmin = false
}
```

**After:**
```tsx
const { isAdmin } = useAdmin()
```

## Verification
- ✅ Searched entire codebase for improper `isAdmin` usage
- ✅ Confirmed all components properly use `const { isAdmin } = useAdmin()` pattern
- ✅ Build completed successfully without errors
- ✅ Application ready for redeployment

## Impact
- Eliminates the `ReferenceError: isAdmin is not defined` error
- Ensures consistent admin context usage across the application
- Maintains proper React hook usage patterns

## Files Modified
1. `/src/pages/QAQuestionPage.tsx` - Fixed direct `isAdmin` variable declaration

## Build Status
✅ **SUCCESS** - Application builds without errors and is ready for deployment.
